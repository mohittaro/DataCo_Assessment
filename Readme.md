# DataCo Real-time Data Pipeline

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time data pipeline for DataCo, designed to ingest, process, and analyze clickstream data from a web application.The data pipeline is built using Apache Kafka, AWS S3, Apache Spark, and Elasticsearch.

## Approach

The data pipeline follows the following steps:

1. **Data Ingestion from Kafka**: 
   - A Kafka consumer script is used to consume data from the designated Kafka topic.
   - The messages are parsed, and relevant fields such as user ID, timestamp, URL, country, city, and user agent are extracted.
   - The extracted data is stored in AWS S3 using a suitable storage format like CSV or JSON.

2. **Periodic Processing of Clickstream Data in AWS S3**:
   - Apache Spark is utilized to process the stored clickstream data in AWS S3. The `pyspark` library is used for this purpose.
   - A Spark job is developed to read the clickstream data from AWS S3 and perform aggregations.
   - Aggregations include grouping the data by URL and country, calculating the number of clicks, unique users, and average time spent on each URL by users from each country.
   - The processed data is stored in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.

3. **Indexing Processed Data in Elasticsearch**:
   - Elasticsearch is employed as the indexing and searching tool for the processed clickstream data.
   - A script is developed to read the processed data from AWS S3.
   - The data is indexed in Elasticsearch using the appropriate Elasticsearch client or library, such as the `elasticsearch` library in Python.

## Setup and Usage

To set up and use the data pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Install Apache Kafka and set up a Kafka topic for clickstream data ingestion.

2. Configure AWS S3 and create an S3 bucket for storing the ingested and processed data. Make sure to set up the necessary credentials and permissions.

3. Install Apache Spark and Elasticsearch on your system. Ensure that the required dependencies and libraries, such as `pyspark` and `elasticsearch`, are available.

4. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

5. Set up the necessary configurations and connection details in the respective script.

6. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed for running the script successfully.

## Evaluation Criteria

The implementation of the data pipeline will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Correctness of the implementation**: Ensure that the pipeline correctly ingests data from Kafka, performs aggregations, and indexes the processed data in Elasticsearch.

- **Efficiency and scalability of the data pipeline**: Design the pipeline to handle large volumes of data efficiently and be scalable to accommodate future growth.

- **Readability and maintainability of the code**: Write clean and well-documented code that is easy to understand and maintain.

- **Clarity and completeness of the report**: Provide a clear and comprehensive report summarizing the approach taken and any assumptions made during the implementation of the data pipeline.
